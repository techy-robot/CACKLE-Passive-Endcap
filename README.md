# End Cap

> [!TIP]
> This board is part of a larger modular control board ecosystem, [CACKLE](https://github.com/techy-robot/CACKLE)

The only purpose of this is to provide a nice end to the chain. It has rounded corners like the PSU at the beginning, and it also has a 120ohm termination resistor for the RS485 bus. You can skip using an end cap if you hand solder a termination resistor and tape up the driver edge connectors to prevent shorts.
